# SwiftUI-Examples

This is a personal repo for me to post useful SwiftUI views and extensions I come up with. I'll try to keep things up to date as Swift and SwiftUI continue to evolve, but no promises on timeliness.

At some point, I may check in whole Xcode projects. For now, I'll just be posting individual .swift files that you can drag into your own projects.

### VSlider

This is, as it sounds, a vertical version of Slider. I made it because I ran into lots of problems trying to rotate SwiftUI's built-in Slider view. It should be basically equivalent to Slider, although right now it's not generic, so it only works with Double.
